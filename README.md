# DriveMaster Downloads

**DriveMaster Downloads** is a modern, lightweight **desktop downloader** built with **Python + CustomTkinter** and powered by **yt-dlp** (embedded inside the app). It supports downloading from **YouTube**, **Google Drive public links**, and many direct-media URLs—through a clean UI with **progress**, **speed**, **ETA**, **pause/resume**, and **stop** controls.

> **Goal:** Build a single Windows app you can **double‑click to run** (EXE) without asking users to install Python or extra tools.

## 📦 Build a Single EXE (One File)

### Why FFmpeg matters

* **Best Video + Audio** often requires **merging**, and **Audio Only (MP3)** requires conversion.
* That merging/conversion needs **FFmpeg**.

To make your EXE run on any PC **without users installing FFmpeg**, you should **bundle** `ffmpeg.exe` inside your build.

### Step A — Put FFmpeg in the project

Create a folder:

```
ffmpeg/
  ffmpeg.exe
  ffprobe.exe  (optional but recommended)
```

> You can download Windows FFmpeg builds from trusted sources (see FAQ below).

### Step B — Build with PyInstaller (One File)

> Replace `DriveMaster Download.py` with your real filename if different.

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --name "DriveMasterDownloads" \
  --add-binary "ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe;." \
  --add-binary "ffmpeg/ffprobe.exe;." \
  "DriveMaster Download.py"
```

Output EXE will be in:

```
dist/DriveMasterDownloads.exe
```

✅ Your script already includes logic to detect bundled ffmpeg inside `sys._MEIPASS` and set `ffmpeg_location`.

## 🧠 Notes About “No Install / No Extra Files”

What you **can** achieve:

* Users can run a **single EXE** with no Python.
* You can bundle FFmpeg into the EXE so users don’t install it.

What you **cannot** fully control:

* If user selects **Browser Cookies**, the browser must exist on their PC.
* Some websites require sign-in / cookies / DRM restrictions and may block downloads.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### 1) EXE opens then closes immediately

* Build without `--noconsole` once to see logs:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --name "DriveMasterDownloads" "DriveMaster Download.py"
```

### 2) “ffmpeg not found” / merge fails

* Make sure you bundled `ffmpeg.exe` (and ideally `ffprobe.exe`).
* Or switch format to **Video Only** / **Best** that does not need merging.

### 3) Antivirus deletes the EXE

* Some AV tools flag one-file executables.
* Build on a clean machine, keep dependencies updated, and optionally code-sign.

### 4) Google Drive private links fail

* Use **Browser Cookies** or **Cookies File**.
* Public links should work in **Public Link** mode.
